## The Idea

Last year, I was frustrated with the existing content sharing solutions. They were either too slow, required sign-ups, or lacked modern UX. I set out to build TextShare.xyz—a zero-friction, multi-utility content sharing platform that lets you share text, files, URLs, QR codes, and even create bio link pages without signing up.

The vision was clear: **Share everything, no cap** 🚀

## Tech Stack Decision

I chose:
- **Next.js 15.5.4**: Full-stack React framework with optimized performance
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire project
- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable data persistence
- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database access with schema migrations
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid UI development
- **Vercel**: Serverless deployment with zero configuration

## Architecture Overview

TextShare follows a clean, modular architecture:

```
Frontend (Next.js pages + components)
        ↓
API Routes (Next.js serverless functions)
        ↓
Prisma ORM (Database abstraction)
        ↓
PostgreSQL (Data persistence)
```

### Key Features Implemented

**1. Text Sharing**
- Syntax highlighting with markdown support
- Auto-expiry after configurable duration
- View count analytics
- Optional password protection

**2. File Upload**
- Chunked upload for large files
- Up to 10MB per file, 25MB total
- Progress tracking
- Automatic cleanup after expiry

**3. URL Shortening**
- Custom short codes
- Click analytics
- QR code generation
- Redirect tracking

**4. Bio Links**
- Create customizable link tree pages
- Drag-and-drop reordering
- Custom styling options
- Analytics dashboard

## Building the Database Schema

I used Prisma migrations to version the database:

```prisma
model Paste {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  content   String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  expiresAt DateTime
  password  String?
  viewCount Int      @default(0)
}

model Share {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  type      String   // 'text', 'file', 'url', 'qr'
  data      Json
  expiresAt DateTime
  views     View[]
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexing**: Added indexes on frequently queried fields
2. **API Caching**: Implemented Redis-like caching patterns
3. **File Streaming**: Direct streaming for file downloads
4. **CDN Integration**: Vercel's edge network for static assets
5. **Database Connection Pooling**: Managed with Prisma client

## Deployment to Vercel

Deployment was seamless:

1. Connected GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set environment variables (DATABASE_URL, API keys)
3. Configured build settings
4. One-click deployment

Vercel's serverless functions handle all API requests, PostgreSQL on managed hosting (Supabase) stores data, and the edge network serves static content.

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Rate Limiting is Critical**: Implemented request throttling to prevent abuse
2. **Data Expiry Management**: Scheduled cleanup jobs to remove expired shares
3. **User Privacy**: Implement strict CORS and CSRF protections
4. **Monitoring**: Set up logging and error tracking with Sentry
5. **Documentation**: Write clear API docs for third-party integrations

## Results

TextShare now:
- Handles 1000+ shares daily
- Serves 50+ requests per minute
- Achieves 99.9% uptime
- Processes uploads in under 500ms

## What's Next?

Future plans include:
- Collaborative sharing sessions
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Browser extensions
- Mobile app

## Conclusion

Building TextShare taught me invaluable lessons about full-stack development, from database design to production deployment. The modern JavaScript ecosystem is incredibly powerful for building production applications quickly.
