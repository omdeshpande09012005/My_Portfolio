I spent two intense days at **GITEX Global 2025** and **North Star Dubai**. Three themes jumped out:

## 1) AI Infra is Consolidating

Vendors are pushing integrated stacks: model hosting + vector DB + RAG pipes + observability. The winners emphasize **operability** (uptime, cost controls) over raw benchmark scores.

## 2) Developer Experience is a Moat

The best booths showcased **fast feedback loops**: structured logs, eval harnesses, red/green deployments. Tooling that shortens the build→measure→learn cycle gets adoption.

## 3) Boring Tech, Beautiful Products

Static websites with smart caching, queue-backed webhooks, and CSV exports drew more real buyers than flashy demos. Reliability sells.

## Takeaways I'm Bringing Back

- Add evals/observability to AI features early.
- Cost guardrails (quotas, graceful degradation) are part of UX.
- Public roadmaps + issue labels signal maturity to integrators.

Photos and a few booth shout-outs coming soon.
